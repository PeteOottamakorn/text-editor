## Installation

Navigate to the directory in your terminal and use 'npm i' to install all the necessary dependencies. After the installation is complete, use 'npm run start' to start the server and access the text editor in your browser. From the browser, this can also be installed as an app to your device by clicking on the icon in the address bar that looks like a computer with a down-facing arrow.

## Usage

In order to use the project, simply type your script into the text field and then click outside of the text field in order to save your text to the browser's database.

## Contributing

How to contribute to this project:

Ease of use can be improved by adding a button to handle the function of saving the text to the database instead of having to click off of the text field.
